1. Let’s start by checking out the whole transactions table. What is the total money_in in the table?

SELECT *
FROM transactions;


2. The money_out column records the amount (in USD) the user sold. What is the total money_out in the table?

SELECT SUM(money_in)
FROM transactions; 

3. The money_out column records the amount (in USD) the user sold. What is the total money_out in the table?

SELECT SUM(money_out)
FROM transactions; 

4. It was reported that Bitcoin dominates Fiddy Cent’s exchange. Let’s see if it is true within these dates by answering two questions:
  - How many money_in transactions are in this table?
  - How many money_in transactions are in this table where ‘BIT’ is the currency?

SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions;

SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'BIT';


5. What was the largest transaction in this whole table? Was it money_in or money_out?

SELECT MAX(money_in)
FROM transactions;

SELECT MAX(money_out)
FROM transactions;

6. What is the average money_in in the table for the currency Ethereum (‘ETH’)?

SELECT AVG(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'ETH';

7. Let’s build a ledger for the different dates. Select date, average money_in, and average money_out from the table. And group everything by date.

SELECT date, AVG(money_in), AVG(money_out)
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;

8. To make the previous query easier to read, round the averages to 2 decimal places. Give the column aliases using AS for readability.


SELECT date, ROUND(AVG(money_out),2) AS 'Average Money In', 
ROUND(AVG(money_out), 2) AS 'Average Money Out'
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;
